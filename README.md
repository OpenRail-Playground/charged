Challenge 9: **Monitoring and management of railway vehicle batteries**.

The transition to battery-powered vehicles in the railway sector is essential for meeting net-zero climate targets, but it presents unique challenges in battery management and monitoring.

- **Transition to Net-Zero**: Replace diesel-powered vehicles with battery-powered alternatives to meet climate targets.
- **Increased Battery Use**: Anticipate a surge in diverse batteries across various vehicles and suppliers.
- **High-Costs**: Large capacity batteries are costly and new to the railway sector, necessitating careful monitoring.
- **Need for Standardization**: Address the lack of standardized analysis methods and error warning systems for effective battery management.
